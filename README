bleualign README


REQUIREMENTS
------------

The software was developed on Linux using Python 2.6, but should also support newer versions of Python (including 3.X) and other platforms.
Please report any issues you encounter to sennrich@cl.uzh.ch


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

The input and output formats of bleualign are one sentence per line.
A line which only contains .EOA is considered a hard delimiter (end of article).
Sentence alignment does not cross these delimiters: reliable delimiters improve speed and performance, wrong ones will seriously degrade performance.

Given the files sourcetext.txt, targettext.txt and sourcetranslation.txt (the latter being sentence-aligned with sourcetext.txt), a sample call is

./bleualign -s sourcetext.txt -t targettext.txt --srctotarget sourcetranslation.txt -o outputfile

It is also possible to provide several translations and/or translations in the other translation direction.
bleualign will run once per translation provided, the final output being the intersection of the individual runs (i.e. sentence pairs produced in each individual run).

./bleualign -s sourcetext.txt -t targettext.txt --srctotarget sourcetranslation1.txt --srctotarget sourcetranslation2.txt --targettosrc targettranslation1.txt -o outputfile

./bleualign -h will show more usage options
